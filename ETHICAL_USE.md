# Ethical Use Addendum (Non‑Binding under MIT)

This project is released under the MIT license for maximal openness. In addition,
contributors request the following principles be respected when using this code or
derivatives:

1. **No exploitation.** Do not deploy results to harm workers, communities, or
   vulnerable populations; do not repurpose for targeted manipulation or warfare.
2. **Transparency.** Disclose when this work or derivatives are used in decision‑making.
3. **Reciprocity.** If you make material improvements, contribute them back when possible.
4. **Attribution.** Credit the project and named collaborators in derived works and papers.
5. **Safety.** Evaluate risk if applying to autonomous systems; keep a human in the loop.

These norms are not legal restrictions, but a public standard for ethical conduct.
